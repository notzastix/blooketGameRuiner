# blooketGameRuiner
A variarty of scripts to "ruin" blooket games.

# How did we do it?
Blooket is very insecure, we all know that, but their websockets and firebase are even more insecure<br>
This repo is essentialy a bunch of scripts meant to "ruin" games / abuse exploits and things that the blooket devs overlooked while coding blooket.

# How do I use it?
Just like any other blooket script:
1. copy the script from its dedicated file
2. open console on blooket
3. paste the code into the console
4. Enjoy!
